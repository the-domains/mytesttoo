            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Space Life</h1><p>How does it feel to be in space? How will animals like to stay in close to no gravity? Will they be any changes in their body structure? What about Christmas in space? Or maybe writing in space? How will this work?

And when they’re back they are normal. This is an example of how microgravity affects us. If you go up to space and comeback down you may drop things like mugs because of getting used to low gravity.
